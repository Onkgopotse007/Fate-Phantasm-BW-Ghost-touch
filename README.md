# dotnet-7-rpg
This is a sample project I did to showcase my knowledge of .NET 7 feel free to reuse the code or even better give me pointers on improving my code.

There's two branches, if you want to make a simple crud app use development-crud-only while the complete project will be on development.
I will add a separate branch with crud operation + authentication

Features
- Global exception handling middleware
- Validation of inputs using fluent validations
- Logging with serilogger
- Data transfer objects with Automapper
- Object Relational Mapping with EF core
