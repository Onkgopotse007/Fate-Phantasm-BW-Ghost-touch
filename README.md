# dotnet-7-rpg
This is a sample project I did to showcase my knowledge of .NET 7 feel free to reuse the code or even better give me pointers on improving my code.
My aim is to make an RPG based on the fate anime series, fate/zero and fate/stay night, I have settled on having 14 characters and have been able to balance their stats, been able to prevent players from choosing more than 1 character from the same class and have included one of the unique heroic spirits "Avenger" Angra Mainyu, I do think I might've maybe made it overkill by allowing a player to have 7 characters, all that's left for me is to balance their noble phantasms, then I will get into the game part of this project.

Hopefully this doesn't end in a cease and desist or copyright lawsuit ðŸ˜‚

There's two branches, if you want to make a simple crud app use development-crud-only while the complete project will be on development.

I'm on a break currently as I have to attend to work duties, I'll continue on the first of September as I aim to take some time off of programming.

Features
- Global exception handling middleware
- Validation of inputs using fluent validations
- Logging with serilogger
